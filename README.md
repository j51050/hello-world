Hello Professor Olsson! This is Elena Chin. Thank you for letting me switch section and I apologized for the late assignments. 
I was also an Ag. Econ master student; although I have graduated in May, I still worked for them. Since I took a month off to visit my family in Taiwan, they have heavy amount of taskes for me to complete asap. I'll keep working and try my best to catch up. Thank you again! 

Learning Github is really fun!
